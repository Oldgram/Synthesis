# Synthesis

Repository to regroup the synthesis I created for the different courses of my CS studies.

## Compilation

All the synthesis are based on the same LaTeX template (located in `Template/`).

They can be compiled using the `make all` target.

The folder `TexMakerSessions` contains the different sessiosn for TexMaker, the application used to create those synthesis.
